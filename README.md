# My resume/cv


Written in latex using [texpad](https://www.texpad.com).

I found that I had to install mactex using:

``` sh
brew install --cask mactex
```

which takes a pretty long time (about 20 minutes for me).
I tried using texpad's built-in latex processor, but the bibtex
stuff didn't seem to work.
